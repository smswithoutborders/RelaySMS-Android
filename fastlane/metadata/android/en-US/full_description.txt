SWOB ("SMSWithoutBorders", AKA "SMS Sithout Borders") is a platform which enables users with a smartphone to communicate with online third-party platforms using SMS messages.

A typical use-case of the platforms is sending out emails from platforms such as Gmail accounts. This becomes a useful tool in cases where access to the internet is limited or completely unavailable. Usage of SWOB entails having a proactive approach to maintaining your communications; the features that SWOB supports require the users to take delebrate actions prior to usage.

Our goal is not to replace the internet; for the most part, the internet is an already efficient method of communication with many abilities that surpass what's possible with simple SMS. Unfortunately, we still have a good portion of telecom users in the world who will have to rely on SMS for tasks built for the internet. Based on value, internet based communications are cheaper than SMS based communications. We are using SWOB on the basis of accessibility of a communication medium.
